# Kultra-Mega-Stores-Inventory Analysis

## Description 
This project is focused on analyzing an order data at Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) which specialises in office supplies and furniture. The Dataset is a csv.file containing order data from 2009 to 2012. I am doing this to gain an understanding of the customer base and to answer the questions listed below:

~~~~~
Case Scenario I
1. Which product category had the highest sales?
2. What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?
3. What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?
4. Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom
10 customers
5. KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

Case Scenario II
6. Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically
purchase?
7. Which small business customer had the highest sales?
8. Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 â€“ 2012?
9. Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?
10. Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?
11. If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and
Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company
appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer
